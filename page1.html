            <h3>How I knew About Karate</h3><br>
            <p> For as long as I can remember I would watch karate movies with my dad.
                He had three of the "Karate Kid" movies, the newer one with Jackie Chan, and so much more
                that I can't remember all of them. We also had the "Kung Fu Panda" movies growing up. My little
                brother and I would also pretend that we were the characters in the moives and try to do the moves,
                we probably were pretty bad at it. From watching all those movies sparked the desire to
                pursue karate, I remember one of my classmates in kindergarten or in 1st grade saying that he does
                karate and I thought that was really cool and wanted to do karate. <br>
            </p>
            <br><h3>How it Started</h3><br>
            <p>
                Fast forward to January of 2022, when after my brother and I had done our
                private class to see if we wanted to pursue karate which is Okinawan style known as Shorin-ryu
                Shorinkan. At the time my brother and I were homeschooled
                and we needed the phyiscal education. At first going to the dojo (Karate school) was like a chore
                for my brother. He would go to the bathroom a lot to get out of doing it. There were a couple of times
                where my family had something to do the day of belt testing. I was fortunate enough that the year of
                2022 we
                were allowed to double test. Double testing is where we were allowed to test for the next belt and the
                one after the belt
                you were orginally testing for.<br>

            <h3>Where I am at Today</h3><br>
            <p>
                Currently in 2023 I have just tested for my yellow belt in October. It is a big step for
                me and those who do the tested for their next belt in the same test as I did. For the new yellow belts
                where I train,
                which there is two of us, we can do the advanced class, where we can dig a little bit deeper on how to
                apply our skills from the
                basic class. We also get to do something call Kobudo, or otherwise known as "Old Martial Arts" or
                weapons in Japanese. First Kobudo
                class we learned Nunchaku or "nunchucks", let's just say I hit my elbow a couple of times trying to get
                the Nunchaku katas down.
                To me karate is something that I enjoy doing whenever I can. No matter what happened before you step
                onto the floor
                of the dojo all you can do is tune it out and focus on your karate training. Everyones karate training
                journey is different
                and that's ok. <br>
                Something I have learned for the 2 years that I have been doing karate and it was something my Sensei
                has said.
                He said "If you want something in life you have to fight for it even when you are on the ground, you get
                back up and push through it and say 'Bring it on!'"
                I try to use in what he has said but in my own way, where if I want something so bad I will chase it
                until I have achieved what I have been chasing, and I won't give it up no matter
                how hard the journey to get to that point I will fight whatever comes my way that will try and stop me
                form achieving whatever that I'm chasing.

            <h3> Facts about Shorin-ryu Shorinkan</h3>
           <br> <p>
                The Nihanchi Kata is believed to be practiced in the 1400s, where reseachers have found some recordings
                of the moves of the kata. Nihanchi is divided into 3 Katas, Nihanchi Shodan, Nihanchi Nidan, and
                Nihanchi Sandan. </p>
