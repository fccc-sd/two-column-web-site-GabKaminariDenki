            <h3>How I learned about DnD</h3><br>
            <p class="indent">I knew about DnD but never really played it until my brother and his friends were playing it when we went
                to
                their house.
                There were times where I would join in or sit and watch them play. That table is absolute chaos, not
                like "I
                want this to happen" or
                "I want to so this", no I mean they were yelling over each other trying to do something, and I can't
                stand
                sitting there for five
                minutes. My brother's friends would let their now 6 year old brother play, and he's in that phase where
                everything has to, well, die.
                They made it simpler to play from what it actually is, but I can't understand it, Probably beacuse I
                like to
                follow how it's suppose to work. </p>
                <p class="indent">I even tried to start my own campaign with them, well I ended that one after a week because they say
                that it
                was really restricting on the rule portion,
                and it made me upset when I tried to help them make their characters and get it started, they just
                didn't
                wnat to put in the effort to try it my way of playing,
                and they said some hurtful things that I won't say. Before I started my own campaign however, months
                before
                I played a one-shot DnD campaign
                in a book club that I was in, and it was super fun. <br>
